# Definition of Done

**Version:** 1.1 · **Date:** 2026-11-11

An issue is done when its commit is on `main`. Before you run `gh tt deliver`, check that:

1. The acceptance criteria in the issue are met.
2. The code follows the [coding standards](coding-standards.md), and its behaviour is covered by tests as described in [Testing](coding-standards.md#testing).
3. At least two people have seen the change, following the [four-eyes principle](../CONTRIBUTING.md#four-eyes-principle).
4. Documentation affected by the change is updated.
5. Follow-up work is a new issue on the board, not a `TODO` in the code.

After `deliver`, the [ready flow](../CONTRIBUTING.md#delivery) checks the rest automatically. Formatting, build, tests and the SonarQube quality gate must all pass before the commit reaches `main`.
